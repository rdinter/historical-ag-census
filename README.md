# United States Censuses of Agriculture for the years 1840 to 2012

Data are available from [ICSPR Study 35206](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/35206), which need to be downloaded individually as the website password protects its downloads.

The [historical_farmland.R](historical_farmland.R) is one example of extracting data from the zip files. The variables which are to be extracted have been identified in the [vars-wide.csv](vars-wide.csv) file, although it took a considerable amount of time to identify the variable names in the documentation. Codebooks are found within each .zip file to be downloaded off of the ICPSR site.
